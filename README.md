# DivGame - a "canvasless" game

The game is displayed in an HTMLDivElement, a.k.a. `div`. Every element in the game is an HTML element. The logic is implemented in C, compiled to WebAssembly using `clang`.

## How to build
Run
```
./tools/build-and-run.sh
```
This will compile the game and start a minimal HTTP server listening to port 8001.

Open a Web browser at `localhost:8001`

## How to play
- 'g' (for GO) to start
- 'w' to move UP
- 's' to move DOWN
- 'a' to move LEFT
- 'd' to move RIGHT
- 'p' to pause

## Compiler/linker errors on MacOS
When I tried to compile a `C` file to `wasm`, I couldn't get it to work, although I had followed all the possible guidelines I could find (e.g., the one above).
By adding the `-v` flag to the `clang` command, I was able to detect the lack of `wasm-ld` linker in my system.
Luckily, I found a comment on [starckoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57322431/wasm-ld-not-found-after-performing-brew-install-wabt) stating that `wasm-ld` is shipped as part of `lld`.
